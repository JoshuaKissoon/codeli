Algorithm used for menu parsing
Input: A HashMap<String url, Array data> of menu's
Output: A HashMap<String url, Array data> of menu's the currently logged in user can access

v0.1 
Improvement: Retrieve all routes in one database request and store them locally in an array indexed by the URL

Complexity: n + 1 + n= 2n


v0.0 - Basic
1. Foreach(menu as url => data)
2. Retrieve Route from Database
3. If user does not have Route.permission
    3.1. Remove this URL from the set of menu's

Complexity: n + n + n = 3n

Boundary Case: If no route exist in the DB for a URL - remove it from the menu
