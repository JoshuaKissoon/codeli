About the module dependency feature

This feature allows a module to set that it is dependent on other modules

Runtime working:
1. Load Module
2. If module has dependencies, get the list of them
3. Foreach (dependencies as dependency)
    Load Dependency Module


Getting the list of a module dependencies
- Criteria: Dependencies need to be in order which to load

- Use a recursive function for this and add a priority

=> Variables
    - L: list of all current dependencies

function addDependencies(&L, ModuleName)
1. Get the list l of dependencies for the current module
2. If every member of l is already in L, exit
3. Foreach dependency d in l
    3.1. If d is in L, continue
    3.2. If d is not in L
        3.2.1. Add d to L
        3.2.2. call addDependencies(d)
